# Solana Crash Game Project Summary

## Overview

This project implements a complete, production-ready Solana smart contract for a Crash game vault system using the Anchor framework. The contract provides a secure way to manage user funds, place bets, and distribute winnings.

## Features Implemented

1. **Game Authority Management**
   - PDA-based authority with admin privileges
   - Only admin can resolve bets with winnings

2. **Secure Vault System**
   - SOL deposits go to a program-controlled vault
   - Balance tracking on-chain via user-specific PDAs
   - Complete separation of user balances

3. **Betting System**
   - Users can place bets using their on-chain balance
   - Admin-only resolution of bets with winnings
   - Balance updates with proper checked math

4. **Security Measures**
   - Reentrancy protection (zeroing balances before transfers)
   - Overflow/underflow prevention with checked math
   - Authority checks for admin-only functions
   - Proper PDA derivation and validation

## Smart Contract Structure

The contract includes five main instructions:

1. **initialize** - Sets up the game authority with admin rights
2. **deposit** - Allows users to add SOL to their game balance
3. **withdraw** - Allows users to withdraw their entire balance
4. **place_bet** - Deducts a bet amount from the user's balance
5. **resolve_bet** - Admin adds winnings to a user's balance

## Testing

All features are thoroughly tested with comprehensive test cases:
- Authority initialization
- Deposit functionality (SOL transfer + balance update)
- Bet placement (balance deduction)
- Bet resolution (admin adding winnings)
- Withdrawal process (SOL return + balance reset)

## Administration

Admin operations like resolving bets can be performed using the provided admin keypair and CLI commands as detailed in the admin guide.

## Full Implementation

The project provides all necessary files for a complete Anchor project:
- Smart contract code (lib.rs)
- All configuration files (Cargo.toml, Anchor.toml)
- Test suite (crash_game.ts)
- Admin keypair and CLI guide

The contract is ready for deployment to any Solana environment (devnet, testnet, or mainnet) with minimal configuration changes.
